# The r+ file mode opens a file for reading and writing. The file is not
# truncated, but the file pointer (or cursor) is placed at the start of the
# file, so contents will begin to be overwritten.
# In our example, we overwrite the first line with 'Line 0'
# We store the current position in a variable and skip over 'Line 2' (the value
# is 8 because we have a newline character at the end of the new Line 0 and
# Line 2)
# we then write in "line 6"
# We then use the second parameter of seek() to move the pointer to the end of
# the file. The second argument of seek() is optional. Normally, we just supply
# an offset from the start of the file, but seek() can take the following
# parameters:
# seek(offset, from_where)
# The offset, we are already familiar with. from_where is: 0 (default) offset
# from the beginning of the file; 1 offset from the current file pointer or
# 2 offset from the end of the file. So seek(0,2) moves us to the end of the file
